This is a very simple chess game that I wrote using SDL2 for rendering. At some point I'll finish this with AI, networked multiplayer, and all that, but for now this serves as a reasonable example of my coding ability.

If you're interested in actually running the project, you'll need to follow the instruction on this page: https://www.strivix.com/learn-programming/learn-sdl/learn-sdl2

That's a tutorial I started writing on the SDL2 library that I have also not had time to finish. Hopefully I will be able to return to that soon. However, that site is also a good example of my web design abilities if that's of interest to you.
